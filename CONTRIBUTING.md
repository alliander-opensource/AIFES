## Signing the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
This project utilize a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to ensure that each commit was written by the author or that the author has the appropriate rights necessary to contribute the change. Specifically, we utilize [Developer Certificate of Origin, Version 1.1](http://developercertificate.org/),  which is the same mechanism that the LinuxÂ® Kernel and many other communities use to manage code contributions. The DCO is considered one of the simplest tools for sign-offs from contributors as the representations are meant to be easy to read and indicating signoff is done as a part of the commit message.

This means that each commit must include a DCO which looks like this:

`Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>`

The project requires that the name used is your real name and the e-mail used is your real e-mail. Neither anonymous contributors nor those utilizing pseudonyms will be accepted.

There are other great tools out there to manage DCO signoffs for developers to make it much easier to do signoffs:
* Git makes it easy to add this line to your commit messages. Make sure the `user.name` and `user.email` are set in your git configs. Use `-s` or `--signoff` to add the Signed-off-by line to the end of the commit message.
* [GitHub UI integrations]( https://github.com/scottrigby/dco-gh-ui ) for adding the signoff automatically to commits made with the GitHub browser UI
* Additionally, it is possible to use shell scripting to automatically apply the sign-off. For an example for bash to be put into a .bashrc file, see [here](https://wiki.lfenergy.org/display/HOME/Contribution+and+Compliance+Guidelines+for+LF+Energy+Foundation+hosted+projects). 
* Alternatively, you can add `prepare-commit-msg hook` in .git/hooks directory. For an example, see [here](https://github.com/Samsung/ONE-vscode/wiki/ONE-vscode-Developer's-Certificate-of-Origin).
