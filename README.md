## The objective of this project, in the form of a poem

```
Electricity flows through the land,
A force of nature, ever grand,
But with demand that‚Äôs on the rise,
Our grids must evolve to be wise.

Enter AI, with powers vast,
To optimize the power cast,
To manage energy supply,
And help the planet to get by.

With solar panels on the rise,
And turbines spinning to the skies,
Electric cars on every street,
We need the grid to be complete.

But variability is the bane,
Of these renewable energy trains,
The sun may hide, the wind may still,
The power may just fall to nil.

But with AI to lend a hand,
We can create a better brand,
Of grid that‚Äôs smart, that can adapt,
To any change, without mishap.

With data analyzed to a tee,
AI can optimize the energy,
Stored and released when it‚Äôs due,
To power homes and cars anew.

So let us look towards the sun,
And harness wind until we‚Äôre done,
Let AI take control of the grid,
And let clean energy take the lead.
```

### üéÅ Repo functionality

**Automated steps**

- Automatic linting of Python, Markdown, config files, etc. using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Nice default GitHub settings (just install the [Probot settings app](https://github.com/apps/settings) to your repo)
- IDE hints via [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) with good defaults for most languages
- [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io/user-guide/) and [CITATION.cff](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)
- Nice gitignore, dockerignore, changelog, and other misc files
- Example/stub Conda environment file, Vagrantfile, and shields

### üìú Steps to reproduce

**How to download needed data, run the code, etc.**

1. Clone this repository
1. Create virtual environment from yaml:
   `conda env create --file=environment.yml`
1. Run `pre-commit install`.
1. Create a .data folder in the root of the project, this folder is excluded by git. Then, download the data from [Sharepoint (not public)](https://alliander.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/PortfolioSO/Gedeelde%20documenten/Collaboration%20Allianer%20-%20TenneT%20T-Prognose?csf=1&web=1&e=t7pG8a), and move it to the .data folder
1. Commit and push to _main_. Linting and clean-up of output cells is performed automatically. If a linter fails on commit, just re-run. It just meant the linter modified a file.
